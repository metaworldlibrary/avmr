-> search using dates and guest num
-> output room type where it matches from above
-> create account / login account (when we show this out to the panel, there are cases that it doesnt accept registration and jumps back to the home page)
-> summary page (this was pointed out to be not of UX friendly)
-> email sending details of payment, terms, reference code and what not (have an idea on this, i think its name is PHPMailer)
->guest sending payment slip thru upload on the guest dashboard
-> front desk approving the reservation if its paid in full, downpayment, etc etc.
-> guest receives email that the reservation has been confrimed
-> when guest arrives at the resort, front desk assigns room num of what is available with respect to the room type, changing its status to "check in"
-> when checking out, billing details should be printed to mirror what happened within the hotel (shows extra person, extra bed, appliance fee, the price of the room, the discounts from senior citizens, and payment of balance if not paid in full)
